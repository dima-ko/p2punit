The idea of application is to make a distributed testing system for android applications. Situation with android devices is terrible now, even simple code can throw exceptoins on different devices. So, I want to make a distributed testing system for running unit-test on remote devices. Each user will provide his device to test on, and in reward will get time for testing his own.
